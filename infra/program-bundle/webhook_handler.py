"""Stripe webhook for the program tier (docs/program-plan.md).

One endpoint, ``POST /webhook``. Every request is verified against the
endpoint's signing secret before the body is parsed; an unsigned or
mis-signed request is refused with 400 and nothing is read from it.

The webhook is the record of subscription state, not the trigger for a
build. Builds start from the setup form (setup_handler.py) after the buyer
has told us the program's details, and from the weekly refresh
(refresh_handler.py) for active subscriptions. So this handler does little:

- ``checkout.session.completed``: note the session, so a buyer who closes the
  tab before the setup form can be found from the Stripe dashboard and
  helped by hand. Only a checkout for one of this product's prices is noted
  (its line items are read with the restricted key); a checkout for anything
  else on the same Stripe account is ignored. If Stripe cannot be read the
  session is noted as ``unverified`` rather than failing the delivery, so an
  outage never gets this endpoint disabled.
  The row carries no ``expires_at``, so the table's TTL never reaches it and
  the buyer's email address is kept indefinitely. That is what makes the
  help-by-hand above possible at all, and it is the only place this product
  keeps an address outside Stripe; how long it should be kept is a retention
  decision for the operator, recorded here so it is a choice rather than an
  accident of which rows happened to get the field.
- ``customer.subscription.created`` / ``updated``: upsert the subscription's
  status and price. A status other than ``active`` or ``trialing`` stops the
  refresh, and so does a price that is not one of the two refresh prices.
- ``customer.subscription.deleted``: mark it canceled. The row is kept, not
  deleted, so a cancellation is a fact with a date rather than an absence.

A subscription event for a price that is not one of the refresh prices never
creates a row. It only updates a row that already exists, which is a tracked
subscription that moved off the refresh prices; the refresh then stops for it.

Anything else is acknowledged with 200 and ignored; Stripe retries on
non-2xx, and an unknown event type is not a reason to make it retry.
