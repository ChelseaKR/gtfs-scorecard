"""When a program report bundle is promised by (docs/program-plan.md).

``/bundle/`` tells a buyer, on a page taking real money: the archive arrives
"normally within the hour and always within two business days. If it is later
than that, the purchase is refunded." That sentence is a refund liability, so
the date behind it has to be computed somewhere rather than believed.

**One function, one number.** ``PROVISIONING_BUSINESS_DAYS`` is the Python
side of the promise and ``web/bundle/plan.json``'s ``provisioning_business_days``
is the side the purchase page renders from.
``tests/test_delivery_deadline.py`` fails if they, or the prose that spells the
number in words, ever disagree. A promise computed twice is a promise that will
eventually contradict itself, and the contradiction will be discovered by the
buyer.

**Anchored to the checkout, not to the form.** The clock starts when Stripe
records the payment. A buyer who pays on Friday and fills in the setup form on
Monday was promised two business days from Friday, and reading the anchor off
the form would quietly hand us the weekend.

**America/Los_Angeles, end of day.** The buyer's timezone is unknown and
guessing it would be worse than choosing one and saying so. This one is
defensible: the promise is operational, kept by a person re-dispatching a
failed run, and that person and this project are in California. The deadline is
the end of that day in that zone, which is how a reader parses "by Tuesday 16
September" anyway.

**US federal holidays are not business days**, and they are computed from the
rules rather than listed. A hardcoded table of dates is a calendar bomb: it
passes every test until the year it silently runs out. The rules (nth weekday
of a month, plus the Saturday-to-Friday and Sunday-to-Monday observation
shifts) do not expire.

    boto3's resource layer serializes that to ``{"N": "..."}`` and deserializes
    it back to a ``decimal.Decimal`` -- which is not an ``int`` and not a
    ``float``. A reader written as ``isinstance(value, int | float)`` therefore
    refuses every promise this product has ever made, and refuses it silently:
    the order reads as one that made no commitment, so it can be reported late
    and can never be reported as a breach. A fake table hands back the object
    it was given, so nothing short of the real type catches that.

    ``bool`` is excluded because it is an ``int``: ``True`` would otherwise
    read as a deadline one second after the epoch and breach on sight. A
    numeric string is accepted, for the same reason
    ``setup_handler._has_expired`` accepts one -- these rows are hand-editable
    and a value a person can read as a date should not be discarded as
    unreadable. Anything else is "no promise was made", which is what a
    subscription refresh looks like, and is never turned into a fact about
    the buyer's order.

    One conversion, not a type ladder. ``float`` already accepts every shape
    this field can arrive as -- ``int``, ``float``, ``Decimal``, and a string
    of digits -- and a ladder of ``isinstance`` branches ahead of it would be
    redundant with it, which is how the ``Decimal`` case came to be missing
