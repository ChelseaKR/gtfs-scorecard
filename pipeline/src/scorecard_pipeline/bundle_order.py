"""The fulfillment workflow's side of one stored order (``.github/workflows/report-bundle.yml``).

The setup Lambda writes each paid, validated order to the private artifacts bucket as JSON and
dispatches the workflow with nothing but a random reference to it (infra/program-bundle,
``common.store_request``). This module is everything the workflow does with that JSON once it
has it, as four small commands, so that no step has to put a buyer's value into a shell script
or an environment block -- both of which a public repository's run log prints:

``mask REQUEST``
    Print an ``::add-mask::`` line for every value in the order that says something about the
    buyer or grants access -- the bundle id (the download capability), the delivery address,
    the program name, the logo address, and each agency id -- and only then validate it.
    GitHub replaces every later occurrence of a masked value in the log with ``***``, so an
    error message that happens to quote one stays blank.
``cap REQUEST``
    Print the agency cap the order was sold with, for ``scorecard bundle --max-agencies``:
    the archive is held to what was paid for a second time, not only by the setup route.
``archive-key REQUEST``
    Print where the archive goes in the bucket (``bundle.archive_key``).
``email REQUEST MANIFEST``
    Send the delivery email through SES, from ``SES_FROM``, with the download link under
    ``BUNDLE_API_BASE``.

Every command re-validates the order with :func:`bundle.parse_request` before it uses it, so an
object that is not a well-formed order fails the run instead of building something.
