# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this project
uses [SemVer](https://semver.org/) (see `README.md`'s Versioning section for
the declared public surface).

> **Known gap, found while writing this file (2026-07-05):** the `v1.0.0`
> and `v1` tags point at a commit (`0d8778530c...`, "make the scorer ref
> track the action version for the Marketplace") that is **not an ancestor
> of `main`'s current history** — `git merge-base --is-ancestor v1.0.0 HEAD`
> returns false, and a tree diff between the tag and `HEAD` touches over
> 28,000 files. The branch was evidently rewritten (rebased or
> history-squashed) at some point after the tag was cut, orphaning it. This
> is a real REL-07/REL-08 problem beyond what the 2026-07-05 audit named
> (lightweight/unsigned tags) — the tag doesn't just lack a signature, it no
> longer corresponds to reachable history. Recommended fix, for a human to
> decide and execute (not done here — retagging is a real git operation
> this remediation pass does not perform): cut a new annotated, signed point
> release (e.g. `v1.0.1` or `v1.1.0`) against current `main` as part of
> landing the real release pipeline (remediation P1-10), and treat `v1.0.0`
> as a permanently historical marker rather than trying to move it.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `scorecard report` (also `python -m scorecard_pipeline.report`): renders one
  agency's published scorecard as a single self-contained HTML file for a
  board packet or a grant application, printable to PDF, with an optional
  `--brand` YAML (name, logo, accent) so a state program or consultancy can
  put its name on reports for the agencies it supports. See
  `docs/board-report.md`.
- "Fixes shared across this group" section on `/program/<state>/` pages (#23).
- `docs/crosswalk.md` rendered as an on-site `/crosswalk/` page (#22).
- Fix-KB pages and validator rule links for the four highest-prevalence
  realtime gaps (#21).
- California Minimum GTFS Guidelines checklist on agency pages (#19).
- Neutral peer-distribution framing on per-state program pages (#17).
- "Expired over a year" findings split by whether the feed URL itself still
  answers (#16).
- Several more fix-KB gap closures for the most common validator findings
  (#15, #18).
- 2026-07-05 remediation pass (this change): restored the vendored
  `docs/standards/ACCESSIBILITY-STANDARD.md` to its pinned upstream state;
  added a `## Standards conformance` + `## Observability` + `## Versioning`
  section to `README.md`; reconciled `pipeline/pyproject.toml` /
  `CITATION.cff` / `server.json` to one version number with a `make verify`
  drift check; added dependency-audit (pip-audit + osv-scanner), CodeQL
  (python + actions), zizmor, TruffleHog, and OpenSSF Scorecard workflows;
  authored (not yet applied — see the workflow files) a branch-protection
  ruleset; this CHANGELOG and a wheel-build CI step.

### Fixed
- Badge embed's copied Markdown now names the agency and grade instead of
  the generic "GTFS data quality" (#24, and an earlier partial fix).
- `shapes_readiness` allowed in the artifact schema — was failing 100% of
  runs since the prior release that introduced it (#20).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-21

First tagged release (`v1`/`v1.0.0`, GitHub Actions Marketplace). Summarized
rather than itemized commit-by-commit: the tag predates a history rewrite on
`main` (see the note above), so an exact commit list can't be reconstructed
from `git log` against current history. As of this tag, the repo shipped:

### Added
- The scoring pipeline (fetch → MobilityData validator → score → publish)
  covering Correctness, Freshness, Rider-experience completeness, and
  Realtime quality, with plain-language findings and "top 3 things to fix."
- The static frontend (agency picker, scorecard pages, trend charts) with a
  WCAG-AAA-targeted accessibility posture.
- The composite GitHub Action (`action.yml`) gating a caller's CI on feed
  grade/expiry, published to the Marketplace as `ChelseaKR/gtfs-scorecard@v1`.
- NTD certification-readiness signals and the `agencies.yaml` scale-out path
  (grown to roughly 1,100 agencies nationally by 2026-07).
- Realtime drift/plausibility checks, embeddable grade badges, and rollup
  views across agency cohorts.
